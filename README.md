# FlightManagementProgram
This was a project that I made in C++ for one of my courses at the University of Calgary. It is a simple Flight Management System which is simulating a flight where you are able to add/remove passengers, view the seat map & passenger information, and save the data if desired. Please reach me at elgizabbasov2001@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.
